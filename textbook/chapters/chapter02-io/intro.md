# Introduction

Think of the programs or software you use. Any program that is useful and interesting must interact with the user. Thus we will begin by showing how a program takes input from users and outputs information back for them. The concepts are simple, but they will pave the way for building more complex programs. As developers, we often want to examine the inner workings of a program by printing *debugging messages*. This is extremely useful!

Topics in this chapter will include `cin`, `cout`, string streams and file streams.
